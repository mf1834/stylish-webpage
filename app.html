			<em>SKILL PIVOTING</em>.  As recently advised on the first assigned project
			this is	not my first attempt at programming.  However with recent changes
			at work I have decided I wanted to try something a little different.  I am
			currently in a network department where I manage a group of technicians that
			assist with outside forces for the installation of fiber services to a
			customers site.  Before this I was actually outside doing installation of
			copper servies to the site.  In both instances learning the product was fun
			However I have decided its time for a change.  Web programming here I come.
			Though I only taught myself the basics initially I am hoping this class
			will lead me in the want for more so that I will continue the programming
			beyond this program.
